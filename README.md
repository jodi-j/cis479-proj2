Welcome to our Minimax AI Tic-Tac-Toe game!

To install pygame, run in terminal:
  pip install pygame 
        OR
  pip3 install pygame 

If you are getting an error that the environment is externally managed:
  python3 -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  pip install pygame

Once all necessary packages are installed, run the ```python runner.py``` command in the terminal in order to play the game against the AI. 
If you choose to play as O, the AI will take a few seconds to make its first move as player X.
